Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank

Overview

This project involves building a credit scoring model for Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider. The objective is to enable a "buy-now-pay-later" service by assessing customers' creditworthiness using data provided by an eCommerce platform. The model predicts the likelihood of default, assigns credit scores, and estimates optimal loan amounts and durations.
